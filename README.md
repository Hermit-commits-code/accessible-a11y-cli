> **A fast, user-friendly CLI for automated accessibility testing of HTML and JSX files using axe-core.**

---

## 🚀 Vision

`accessible-a11y-cli` aims to make accessibility testing simple, fast, and part of every developer's workflow. By leveraging [axe-core](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core), this tool helps you catch and fix accessibility issues early, ensuring your web projects are usable by everyone.

## 📦 Installation

```bash
npm install -g accessible-a11y-cli
```

## 🛠️ Usage

Run accessibility checks on one or more HTML/JSX files or remote URLs:

```bash
a11y-check check path/to/file.html path/to/other.jsx https://example.com
```

### Options

- `-f, --format <type>` Output format: `table` (default), `json`, or `html`
- `-o, --output <file>` Save results to a file
- `--fix` Attempt to auto-fix common issues
- `--verbose` Verbose output

You can mix local file paths and URLs in a single command. URLs must start with `http://` or `https://`.

### Example

```bash
# Check a local file, a JSX file, and a remote URL
a11y-check check test/test.html src/App.jsx https://example.com

# Output results as JSON and save to a file
a11y-check check https://example.com --format json --output results.json
```
